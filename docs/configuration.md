# Configuration

After installation, publish the configuration files by running:

```
php spark doctrine:publish
```

This command will copy a config file to your app namespace and a `cli-config.php` file for Doctrine CLI usage. By default, the config file will be present at `app/Config/Doctrine.php`.

Adjust the configuration as needed for your project.
